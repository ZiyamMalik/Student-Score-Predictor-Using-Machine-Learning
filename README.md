# Student score Prediction

A beginner-level Machine Learning project that predicts a student's exam score based on study hours using **Linear Regression**.
It includes data analysis, model training, prediction, and evaluation using **MAE, MSE, and RMSE**.

### Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

### Workflow

1. Import and explore data
2. Visualize study hours vs. scores
3. Split data (80/20)
4. Train Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate and predict new scores

**Example:** For 9.25 study hours → Predicted score ≈ 92%
